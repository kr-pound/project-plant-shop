# project-plant-shop

Welcome to ***project-plant-shop***, the repository for the backend of the ***Automatic Plant Shop*** project! This project is part of a thesis focusing on the design and implementation of an innovative solution for selling plants through an automatic machine.

Our goal is to enhance convenience and accessibility for both plant sellers and buyers by enabling plant sales at multiple locations simultaneously.

## Project Overview

The Automatic Plant Shop is a comprehensive system aimed at revolutionizing how we think about plant commerce. By integrating cutting-edge technology with the simplicity of plant buying and selling, this project offers a seamless experience for users.

The backend component you're viewing now is crucial for processing transactions, managing inventory, and ensuring the smooth operation of the entire process.

### Feature Examples

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Each machine is equipped with an intuitive user interface, designed to make the buying process as simple and enjoyable as possible. This interface guides buyers through the selection, provides detailed information about each plant, and facilitates a seamless checkout process
- **Inventory management**: Insert and Remove, as well as keep track of plants available for sale, via admin interface.
- **Transaction processing**: Handle purchases made through the automatic plant shop machines via the simulation APIs.


## Getting Started

To get started with the backend of the Automatic Plant Shop, please ensure following [SETUP.md](./docs/installation/SETUP.md), the steps guidance for initial project setup on your system.

> Note that the mentioned setup guidance doesn't includes some integrations with external APIs for `Bank` and `Hardware Controller`. you may require additional setup steps for simulating them if needed.
